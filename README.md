# Krishi Mitra – Smart Crop Advisory System

**Empowering Small and Marginal Farmers with AI-Based Insights**

---

## Problem Description

A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history.

This often leads to:

- Poor crop yield  
- Excessive input costs  
- Environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals  

Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

---

## Impact / Why This Problem Needs to Be Solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can:

- Significantly increase productivity  
- Reduce costs and improve livelihoods  
- Promote sustainable farming practices  
- Strengthen food security  
- Contribute to environmental conservation  

A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

## Expected Outcomes

- A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot providing real-time, location-specific crop advisory  
- Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance  
- Weather-based alerts and predictive insights  
- Pest/disease detection via image uploads  
- Market price tracking  
- Voice support for low-literate users  
- Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement
