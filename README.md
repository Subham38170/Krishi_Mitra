# Krishi Mitra â€“ Smart Crop Advisory System

**Empowering Small and Marginal Farmers with AI-Based Insights**

---

## Problem Statement

In India, a large portion of farmers are small and marginal farmers who face several challenges:

- Limited access to scientific knowledge about soil, fertilizers, and crops.  
- Dependence on traditional practices, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for farming decisions.  
- Poor access to real-time market prices, weather forecasts, and crop advisories.  
- Language barriers that prevent understanding of modern agricultural techniques.  
- Overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, leading to low crop yield, increased input costs, and environmental degradation.  

These issues result in reduced income, wastage of resources, and unsustainable farming practices.
